            <h2>Home</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my little page!</p>
            <p>I am Blorb, also known as confusedcatgirl, and I generated AI Artifacts as a Hobby!</p>
            <p>I like to draw sometimes, and code in various languages from time to time.</p>
            <p>Most of the time, I am pretty laid back, and I like to talk about video games too!</p>
            <p>I like to mess around with game engines, and see what I can make with them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am a former user of AI, due to various reasons, including my own mental health.</p>
            <p>Now, I 3d print models and paint them as a hobby, I might even share them on here!</p>
            <br>
            <p>This page is rather short as of right now, but I hope to extend it into a lot more!</p>

            <h2>Cloud</h2>
            <p>Running locally at my place, this server is only available to a select few. It has been properly configured to utilize HSTS and HTTPS.</p>
            <p>Only a select few, including myself, have access to it, mostly to manage tasks more easily, but also to store files etc.</p>
            <p>It is based on Nextcloud, and is very easy to set up for your own home usage, so go check the original software out!</p>
